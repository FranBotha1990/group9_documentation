# Background and strategic fit

What is the problem we’re solving or niche we’re filling, and how does our organization have the capabilities to exploit this?   

## Why do companies need this tool?

Redacting of information is a required step of companies storing customer data. Data privacy regulations require businesses to redact PII from documents. 

## What makes us a good fit to provide this tool?
 
Morae has the industry knowledge to identify PII and a strong understanding of the various privacy/data laws. 
 
## Current manual process

- Traditionally redaction requires a user manually: 
- Reviewing the document and identifying PII 
- Redacting the document and all other versions of the document. 
- Deleting and potentially renaming the original document

## The problem we aim to solve

- As the volumes of documents increase this process can take months and require a project team. Incurring tremendous cost.

## Proposed solution to the problem

- Allowing automation to this workflow, will reduce the team size and the cost incurred by the business and reduce risk of human error.
